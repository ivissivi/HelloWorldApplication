### Displaying pictures
Images that were taken by the user are being displayed in a slider view and are being cycled through automatically. Right after the image is captured, the thumbnail changes to the most recent image, that was captured by the user.

### Capturing images
For image capturing there is a “TAKE AN IMAGE” button. Images are saved to internal storage and uploaded to Firebase. If everything goes right, a toast message of “Upload successful” appears and the image can be located in the Firebase storage.

### Displaying recordings
Recordings that were recorded by the user are displayed in a list view. Each item contains the full name of the file from storage. File name is generated randomly by adding the current time in milliseconds to the string of the file name.
